## Windows Setup Guide (Docker/WSL)

!!! warning "Docker Desktop"
    Ensure that Docker Desktop is not installed; if so, uninstall and reboot before proceeding.

----

### WSL Install

1. From the Microsoft store, install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

2. From the Microsoft store, install Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

3. Follow the setup to create your Ubuntu username and password

4. From a Windows command prompt, paste the following:

    ```bash
    cd C:\WINDOWS\system32
    ```

5. Then paste:

    ```bash
    wsl --setdefault Ubuntu-22.04
    ```

6. From Windows apps, start Ubuntu 22.04, and paste the following inside the terminal:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo mount --make-rshared /
    ```

!!! note 
     `sudo mount --make-rshared` does not persist reboots, so it will need to be run each time WSL2 or Windows is restarted. Alternatively, see the [Ubuntu systemd service](../faq/rclone.md#ubuntu-systemd-service) guide for automatically executing the command on startup for Ubuntu.

----

### Docker Install

1. Follow the **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)** install guide.

2. Follow the standard docker process for creating the container or follow the [Docker Deployment](docker.md) or [Portainer Deployment](portainer.md) guides

----

### Accessing the mount on Windows

1. From the Ubuntu terminal, paste the following, including the punctuation:

    ```bash 
    explorer.exe . 
    ```

2. A new file explorer window will appear; youâ€™re now inside the Ubuntu directory structure

3. Navigate to the mount location and copy the full path from the explore window

4. From another file explorer window, click "This PC," then right-click in the space below the listed drives and select add a network location

5. In the pop-up, click next twice and past the mount location.

6. Follow the remaining prompted steps
